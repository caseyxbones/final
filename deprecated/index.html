        <p class="heading"> SEPTA Regional Rail Passenger Origins<p>
        <p class="main">by Casey C. Ross for the DVRPC</p>
        <p class="body">
                This web map is an example of the ways in which passenger origin data can be interactively
                visualized by agencies like the DVRPC and SEPTA. Using license plate survey data that is scrubbed
                of identifying information by PennDOT and then aggregated into block groups by origin,
                agencies can map the origins of passengers who drive to Regional Rail stations.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
                This analysis can help us understand who chooses to drive to stations, and can help inform policy around
                multimodal and non-motorized infrastructure improvements around stations as well as parking availability and pricing.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
                This web application was created by Casey C. Ross at the University of Pennsylvania using data provided by the
                DVRPC. Driver origin data presented on this site is property of the DVRPC and is used in this context with its
                express permission. This website is merely intended to provide an example of how the DVRPC could use its driver-origin
                data in the future, and to create a preliminary framework upon which the agency can build if it so chooses.
