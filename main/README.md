# dvrpc-site

This web application was created in May 2017 by Casey C. Ross as a final project for the course CPLN 624: Java Script Programming at the University of 
Pennsylvania School of Design as part of a Master's Degree in City Planning. The course instructors were Jeff Frankl and Nathan Zimmerman of Azavea.

This map was created using HTML, CSS, Leaflet.js, Carto.js, Turf.js, jQUERY,  Bootstrap, and PostgreSQL.

This map is an example of the ways in which passenger origin data can be interactively visualized by agencies like theDVRPC and SEPTA. Using license plate 
survey data that is scrubbed of identifying information by PennDOT and then aggregated into block groups by origin, agencies can map the origins of passengers 
who drive to Regional Rail stations.

Analysis of this kind of data can help us understand who chooses to drive to stations, which can inform policy around multimodal and non-motorized infrastructure
improvements near stations as well as parking availability and pricing. This website is intended to provide an example of thow the DVRPC could use its driver-origin data in the future, and to create a preliminary framework upon which the DVRPC can build if it so chooses.

This web application was created using proprietary data provided by the DVRPC. Driver origin data presented on this site is property of the DVRPC and is used in 
this context with its express permission.
